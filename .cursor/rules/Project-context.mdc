I am a new developer. I have completed intermediate courses on Python, CSS, and HTML. However, I am new to developing for the web, new to contemporary frontend development, new to Drupal, and new to putting a lot of these learnings into action practically, and using best practices. In addition to helping with my requests, where it makes sense to, explain anything which would be helpful for me to learn, clearly and in detail.
