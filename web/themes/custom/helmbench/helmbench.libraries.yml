# Theme Libraries
# Documentation: https://www.drupal.org/docs/theming-drupal/adding-assets-css-js-to-a-drupal-theme-via-librariesyml
#
# Libraries bundle CSS and JS files together. They can declare dependencies
# and be attached to specific pages or components.

# Global library - attached to every page via helmbench.info.yml
global:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    # CSS categories (SMACSS): base, layout, component, state, theme
    # Lower weight = loads first. Use weights to control cascade order.
    theme:
      # Compiled Tailwind CSS output
      dist/css/main.css: {}
  js:
    # Main JavaScript with scroll-spy, mobile nav, and TOC dropdown
    src/js/main.js: {}
  dependencies:
    # Required for Drupal.behaviors and once()
    - core/drupal
    - core/once

# Note: Icon sprite is included inline in templates/layout/html.html.twig
# via helmbench_preprocess_html() in helmbench.theme
# No library definition needed since it's included directly in the HTML

# Theme Toggle - Dark mode toggle button
# Attach using {{ attach_library('helmbench/theme-toggle') }} in Twig.
