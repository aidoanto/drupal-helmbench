# Theme Libraries
# Documentation: https://www.drupal.org/docs/theming-drupal/adding-assets-css-js-to-a-drupal-theme-via-librariesyml
#
# Libraries bundle CSS and JS files together. They can declare dependencies
# and be attached to specific pages or components.

# Global library - attached to every page via helmbench.info.yml
global:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    # CSS categories (SMACSS): base, layout, component, state, theme
    # Lower weight = loads first. Use weights to control cascade order.
    theme:
      # TODO: This is your compiled Tailwind CSS output.
      # Run your build process to generate this file.
      dist/css/main.css: {}
  js:
    # TODO: Add your compiled JS here if needed.
    # dist/js/main.js: {}
    #   attributes:
    #     defer: true
  dependencies:
    # Core dependencies your theme might need.
    # TODO: Uncomment as needed.
    # - core/drupal
    # - core/once
    # - core/jquery (avoid if possible - use vanilla JS)

# Example: Component-specific library
# Attach to specific components using {{ attach_library('helmbench/accordion') }} in Twig.
#
# accordion:
#   version: VERSION
#   js:
#     components/03-organisms/accordion/accordion.js: {}
#   dependencies:
#     - core/drupal
#     - core/once

# Example: Library for a specific page or feature
#
# results-table:
#   version: VERSION
#   css:
#     component:
#       components/03-organisms/results-table/results-table.css: {}
#   js:
#     components/03-organisms/results-table/results-table.js: {}
