# Breakpoints are used by the Responsive Image module to serve different
# image sizes at different viewport widths. These should align with your
# Tailwind CSS breakpoints.

# Mobile-first approach: smallest breakpoint has no media query (it's the default).
# Each subsequent breakpoint targets larger screens.

# TODO: After defining breakpoints:
# 1. Go to Admin > Configuration > Media > Image styles - create image styles
# 2. Go to Admin > Configuration > Media > Responsive image styles - map breakpoints to image styles
# 3. Use responsive image styles in your Views and field formatters
